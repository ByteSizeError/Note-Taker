# Note-Taker

## Description

This project is a note taking app, users can write notes down to be saved for later reference. My motivation for this project was to make something that can be used to takes notes and be referred back to with any device. The problem this solves is it can be used by muliptle people and the notes will be linked to  a single database so everyone will have the same notes. Which can be convient for team projects or as a shopping list for a household.
